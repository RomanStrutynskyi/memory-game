# Memory Game

This is a memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game consists of a grid of cards, each with a hidden image on one side. The player's objective is to find all the matching pairs of cards in the grid.

### Getting Started

To get started, first ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, navigate to the root directory of the project in the command line and run the following command to install any necessary dependencies for the game:

```

npm install

```

The game uses Vite as its bundler. To run the game locally, use the following command:

```

npm run dev

```

This will launch the game in your default web browser and enable hot module replacement for faster development.

To create a production build of the game, use the following command:

```

npm run build

```

This will create a minified and optimized build of the game that can be deployed to a web server.

### How to Play

To play the game, click on a card to reveal the hidden image. Then, click on another card to reveal its hidden image. If the two images match, the cards will remain face up. If they do not match, the cards will be flipped back over.

The game ends when all the matching pairs of cards have been found.

### Customization

The game can be customized by editing `main.js` file. For example, you can change the images used on the cards, adjust the size of the grid, timelimit and etc.
